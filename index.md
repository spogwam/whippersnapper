## About Us: 

Whippersnapper Films is an emerging film and television company based in Edinburgh. It has been started for one specific reason: to help writers and directors, especially those who feel disenfranchised or overlooked in any way, to actualise and achieve their artistic goals. While we hope that we can support as many film-makers as we can, our focus will be on younger talents who are beginning their journey in this industry; the whippersnappers, so to speak.

The company will offer multiple services, including producing short films, developing long-form projects with writers, and offering a free script-reading and feedback service. Our team consists of graduates from the National Film and Television School and Screen Academy Scotland, who have extensive knowledge and experience in screenwriting in particular, which they will be happy to use to help your writing.

Our team has identified many of the prominent issues that are stopping people from gaining entry and access to the film industry, and have devised ideas and solutions for what can be done to combat these. It is important to note however, we are not a company that is actively seeking to undermine or denigrate the film industry: we want to contribute to it, and we want to help others contribute to it.

In this guide, we will break down our company goals and ethos, and what strategies and tactics we will use to realise them.









## 1.	Short Film Productions

There is a lie being loudly touted by several industry figures that this is the easiest time there has ever been to enter the film industry. Wrong – the exact opposite is true. 
The democratisation of film-making equipment, phone capabilities, access to online information, readily available editing software, etc., has meant that the competition has amplified tenfold in the last decade. 
This is compounded by the universities and colleges across the country brazenly accepting applicants without a serious vetting process in place, thereby facilitating disingenuous and malign actors to be in a position to take jobs away from the most creative and dedicated. 
Access to funding is becoming increasingly difficult for emerging film-makers. Despite their portents, funding bodies are risk-averse, and just like the wider industry, they would rather devote financial resources to a tested pair of hands and satisfy their concerns of appearing socially responsible. Furthermore, if current polling is indeed indicative of the country’s political future, the UK will likely see continuous cuts in arts funding post-2029.

So where does that leave us? 
The industry is intimidating. Embrace that, and embrace the competition. We understand the anxieties that come with trying to achieve goals in such an uncertain and volatile place, but it can be done, and we at Whippersnapper are here to support people in whatever capacity we can.
Our team will help film-makers who do not possess the readily sought-after credits and credentials to take proactive steps to ensure that they are in a position to attain these and strengthen their chances of receiving these funds.

How?
Our team has extensive experience creating films that have played at film festivals, including in Cannes and BAFTA-qualifying ones across the UK, and have competed in international competitions and won top awards for best film. We can demonstrate to film-makers that you can make festival and competition-quality short-form projects on a shoestring budget.

We will guide film-makers comprehensively, step-by-step, through the stages of production to maximise individual project quality. We can offer in-depth advice during the development of the script, state-of-the-art equipment to help practically create the film, and professional editing software for post-production.
The team at Whippersnapper have a back catalogue of production-ready short films that will be produced throughout the year, thereby offering opportunities for people wanting on-set experience with a professional company.

Who Are We Looking For?
We are looking for anyone who has not yet had a break in the industry, and as we are based in Edinburgh, we will likely focus on supporting Scottish talent. We are looking for tenacious individuals with a talent for storytelling who are determined to build a future for themselves in the film industry. 
There are non-negotiable behaviours that we would expect participants to exhibit when working alongside us. Firstly, any advice, suggestions or criticisms given by the team to participants are to be taken professionally, not personally. We intend to solely help and advise film-makers in their creative pursuits, and emotionally-hijacked responses to feedback will not be tolerated. 
Secondly, we expect all film-makers to work hard on their projects from the beginning of the process to the end of post-production. We will be on hand at all stages to support you; however, if we feel that participants are really just spectators, then we may consider terminating productions.
Finally, we expect that all participants are tolerant of each other, regardless of political views, religious faith, personality differences or ethnic origin. The strongest works produced in this industry come from the most singular thinkers, and we want to especially ensure that those people are given a platform to tell their stories.








## 2.	Script Development and Script Reading

There are numerous new writers’ schemes available for budding enthusiasts, and like the previously mentioned funding opportunities, they advertise themselves as a chance for new writers to get their foot in the industry door.
The next time you apply for one, and are not selected, look to see who has been. Usually, they are not new writers at all. They are authors, playwrights and people with full representation and industry connections. The most egregious and embarrassing examples of this are the Channel 4 New Writers Scheme, the BBC’s Open Call, and Glasgow Film Festival’s Funny Features.
Despite the seemingly unending demand for (apparently) quality entertainment, the industry will always be happy to resort to the same lacklustre pair of hands.
You cannot get a break in this industry. You need to break in.

One of Whippersnapper’s most exciting and essential unique selling points is its script development programme. Two members of the Whippersnapper team have studied screenwriting at the NFTS and Screen Academy Scotland at post-graduate level, and are prepared to share their insights into the techniques and advice they have received.
The company has completed three feature-length scripts that are examples of the films that we would like to see made in the next five to ten years. Perspective participants will be welcome to see these, but will have to request them in advance.
There is a growing appetite in the UK for comedy, an appetite which is not being satisfied by the subpar output in the form of modern comedy. We are actively seeking comedy writers to help develop their work, regardless of what stage it is at. It doesn’t matter if it is just an idea, if it is at treatment stage, or if it is a first draft script.

What Will We Offer?
Our team will offer one-to-one, specialised advice to much improve your work on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on what best suits your schedule. We will discuss story, structure, character, motivation, dialogue and theme. We can offer advice on how to produce industry-standard treatments, and help you work towards completing a strong speculative screenplay.
Following this, we will help you get it in front of industry readers and devise competition strategies for you, in the hope that it will strengthen your chances of being signed by an agency.
We are looking to help anyone, regardless of their experience level, but we do ask that you send us a sample of your work in advance, so we can gauge your interest in screenwriting and storytelling skills (even if they are unrefined). As previously mentioned, we will be focusing our efforts mainly on comedy works however, we will be happy to accept films that balance comedy with other genres.

We will also be offering a free script reading and feedback service for scripts of any length. This is an open call that will be available all year long. The readers will deliver invaluable and considered critiques to writers, encouraging them to be more rigorous in their work. Please note however, that feedback delivery will be subject to the reader's personal and professional commitments.

















## 3.	Networking Events

Do you find networking events intimidating? 
Do you find them to be pointless? Finding that they are nice in the moment to be able to converse with fellow film-lovers, but afterwards, nothing of any consequence comes of it?

Networking events are becoming more commonplace throughout Scotland, but what will separate our events from a typical one, is that it will be an opportunity for people to inspire and motivate others to pursue their artistic goals through our accountability programme, as well as being able to meet and build industry connections with like-minded people.
We know all too well how hard it can be to motivate yourself into writing, especially if it is not for any professional means; however, those in the industry respond to completed screenplays far more enthusiastically than outlines or treatments, and completed screenplays take time and thought. The programme is intended to motivate people in similar positions to help each other set deadlines and meet them between sessions, thereby strengthening the quality of their work.
Our accountability programme is an optional component of the networking events, but one we would strongly encourage everyone in attendance to participate in. Regardless of involvement, our networking events are designed to be social experiences, and that will always remain their most important purpose.
We hope to diversify the type of networking events that we host beyond pub meetings. These may include, but are not limited to, walks around Edinburgh, team-building activities, group exercises, and trips to the cinema.
All of our proposed networking events will be advertised on social media in advance of their taking place.
